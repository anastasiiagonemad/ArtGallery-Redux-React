<p>Enjoy the paintings of great masters of art!</h2>


<h2>About app:</h2>
<p>Enjoy the works of art of the greatest artists of all time.</p>
<p>This open API contains a lot of information about paintings and their authors.
</p>
<p>In this application, I used the name of the painting and its artist, the painting itself, as well as the buttons to add the painting to favorites or delete it.</p>

<p>When you refresh the page, the paintings will change depending on the response from the server.</p>

<p>(It happens that some paintings do not load and an error comes from the server, this is not scary, just reload the page or delete the painting that is not displayed)


<h2>About working process:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Development with Redux and React</li>
<li>The public API is connected via axios</li>
<li>When an error occurs loading an image from the server, the error is processed and displayed in the console</li>
<li>Using functional components and classic CSS</li>
</ul>
